What is PyEngine?
------------------------

PyEngine is a python library for creating games
2D videos more easily.
It is a kind of very simplified game engine without an interface.

Why create PyEngine?
--------------------

To create a video game in python, there is already the very good PyGame.

But when I created my game, I had to create systems 
(such as the entity system) that are useful for all.
So I chose to create PyEngine (which uses PyGame itself)
(And then it allows a good training in Python).

What are the dependencies of PyEngine?
--------------------------------------

 Apart from Python, PyEngine uses PyGame.

What are the platforms where PyEngine can be used?
--------------------------------------------------

If you can use PyGame and Python, you can use PyEngine.

I would like to participate in the development of PyEngine, how do I do it?
